If the model appears extremely small after loading it into your 3D printing software, the incorrect units are most likely being applied.  Units should be in inches.   To correct this, simply scale the entire model by a factor of 25.4 (25.4mm `~ 1.00in)

If you use Cura, the .amf file should be scaled correctly.
